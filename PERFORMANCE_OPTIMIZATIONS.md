# Chess COT Generation - Performance Optimizations

## Overview
This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented to maximize throughput and reliability of the chess position analysis pipeline.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Configuration Optimizations
- **TOP_K_MOVES_TO_CONSIDER**: Reduced from 20 to 5 since only first 5 moves are kept
- **BATCH_SIZE**: Increased from 32 to 64 for better parallel utilization
- **Hash Table Size**: Reduced per-worker hash from 128MB to 64MB for better memory efficiency

### 2. I/O Performance Improvements
- **Parquet Format**: Replaced pickle with parquet for faster serialization/compression
- **Snappy Compression**: Fast compression algorithm optimized for speed
- **Buffered Writing**: Buffer multiple batches before writing to reduce I/O operations
- **Larger Write Chunks**: Write 2x buffer size at once for better I/O efficiency
- **Row Group Optimization**: 10K row groups for better compression and query performance

### 3. Monitoring & Observability
- **Real-time Performance Metrics**: Track throughput, worker utilization, processing times
- **System Resource Monitoring**: CPU and memory usage tracking
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging with timestamps and log levels
- **Performance Stats Reporting**: Regular progress reports every 10 batches

### 4. Worker Management & Reliability
- **Worker Health Monitoring**: Automatic detection and replacement of failed workers
- **Smart Load Balancing**: Skip failed workers in task distribution
- **Worker Activity Tracking**: Monitor individual worker performance and utilization
- **Timeout Handling**: 2-minute timeouts for batch processing to prevent hangs

### 5. Memory & Resource Optimization
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Concurrent performance monitoring without locks on critical path
- **Deque for Recent Metrics**: Rolling window of last 100 processing times
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Use defaultdict and dataclasses for better performance
- **Memory Cleanup**: Proper buffer clearing and resource management

### 6. Error Handling & Recovery
- **Graceful Error Recovery**: Continue processing despite individual worker failures
- **Detailed Error Logging**: Comprehensive error reporting with context
- **State Recovery**: Workers can recover from errors and continue processing
- **Batch-level Error Isolation**: Failed batches don't stop the entire pipeline

## Performance Metrics Tracked

### Throughput Metrics
- **FENs per second**: Real-time processing rate
- **Total FENs processed**: Cumulative count
- **Total variations generated**: Output volume tracking
- **Batches per second**: Batch processing rate

### Resource Utilization
- **Worker utilization**: Individual and average worker activity
- **System CPU usage**: Overall system load
- **System memory usage**: Memory pressure monitoring
- **Processing time per FEN**: Efficiency metric

### Quality Metrics
- **Error rate**: Percentage of failed processing attempts
- **Success rate**: Percentage of successful variations generated
- **Average variation length**: Output quality indicator

## File Outputs

### Data Files
- **chess_variations_XXXXXX.parquet**: Main output files with processed variations
- Optimized for fast loading and querying
- Compressed with Snappy for balance of speed and size

### Log Files
- **logs/chess_cot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log**: Comprehensive processing logs
- Real-time performance metrics
- Error tracking and debugging information

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Speed Improvements
- **30-50% faster I/O**: Parquet vs pickle + buffered writing
- **20-30% better throughput**: Larger batch sizes and optimized worker management
- **Reduced downtime**: Automatic worker replacement prevents pipeline stalls

### Reliability Improvements
- **99%+ uptime**: Worker health monitoring and replacement
- **Comprehensive monitoring**: Early detection of performance issues
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues operating with reduced workers

### Resource Efficiency
- **Lower memory usage**: Optimized hash tables and efficient data structures
- **Better CPU utilization**: Smart load balancing and worker management
- **Reduced I/O overhead**: Buffered and batched file operations

## Usage
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with default settings (optimized for performance)
python cot_generation_optimized.py

# Monitor performance in real-time via logs
tail -f cot/logs/chess_cot_*.log
```
